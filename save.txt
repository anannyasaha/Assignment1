Saving money can make you rich, ambitious and responsibile.Saving money is not an easy task.
Because when you are earning money or someone is providing you money then you always intend to spend that money in something you like doing or using.
When you roam around in a shopping mall you will buy something or anything if you cant control yourself.but if you decide to save money then you will cut off your
unnecessary habits and needs.For example smoking or any kind of addictive drug abuse,shopping every other week,eating in restaurants everyday etc.

There are lots of benefits of saving money.If one intend to save money then one will understand one's needs better.One will start doing long term planning for money 
and buy something which he actually dreamt for quite a long time for example a porche or a 2 storied house beside the lake.One can visit their dream places by spending
their savings.Because fulfilling these kind of dreams actually bring completeness in your life.Exploring the world can be something worth saving money for.
Another advantage of saving money is you can invest that money somewhere it can grow exponentially. one can save money to invest in education of one's children.
Because my father says education is the most profitable investment
